# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
**SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch‑Success Predictor** – End‑to‑end capstone that ingests SpaceX launch logs, blends API‑collected metadata, and trains a tuned Gradient‑Boosting model to forecast Falcon 9 mission success. Built interactive Jupyter dashboards for EDA (launch sites, payload mass, orbit types), engineered key features like “booster version block” and pad geolocation, and surfaced SHAP explanations to keep the model transparent. Deployed the predictor behind a Flask endpoint and a simple web app so users can toggle mission parameters and see real‑time success probabilities—showcasing my skills in data wrangling, SQL, web‑scraping, feature engineering, ML modeling, and lightweight MLOps.
